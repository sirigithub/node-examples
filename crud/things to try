1) Finish CRU with product catalog
2) finalise end points for requests from front end
3) create rest api for user registration and authentication against db

in routes do the following

localhost:3000/all = all products
localhost:3000/women = all women's clothes
localhost:3000/kids = all kids

localhost:3000/women/dresses
localhost:3000/women/shoes
